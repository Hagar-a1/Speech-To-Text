# Speech-To-Text
## Fourth task
### Hello my friends! This project aims to record the user's voice, then convert it to text, and then save it in a database.
 
 This is the web page, which contains a button to start recording the voice, with an instructional message below it, and finally, a box where the user's spoken words will appear:

This image shows us the text written in the designated box after recording. As we can see, the recording and conversion to text have been done excellently:

Finally, every time a voice is recorded, it is stored in the database named "Converter" and in the table named "SpeakerText," which contains two columns: "id" and "Text." As we can see, the storage process has been done correctly:
